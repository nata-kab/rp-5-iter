# Exercise 5

Using array of IP addresses — [“1.1.1.1”,“2.2.2..2",“3.3.3.3”,“4.4.4.4"], using Axios library for HTTP API calls and API `ip-api.com`, return a Promise for a list of objects containing names and companies assigned to IP addresses in the array. Use a non-mutable functional-programming approach.

Proper result (inside a Promise):
[
{ip: "1.1.1.1", country: "Australia", as:"Cloudflare Inc"},
{ip: "2.2.2.2", country: "Korea", as:"Innyflare Inc"},
]
Use Typescript and Jest tests.
